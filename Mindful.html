            <h1>Newspaper's Thoughts</h1>
            <p> Hope this website found you well. As annoying as I can be, I am here to share everything that's been going on in my head. I do not expect a feedback—just a simple read.
                Was never good at interpreting myself so I do things like this—spent 5 hours coding just so I would not have to face the immediate harshness of reality straight on my 
                face; though, I always knew it eventually make its way to me. I made this website so I could share everything without having to speak of it out loud, nor to embarrass
                myself straight up directly. This took some time of planning and mustering. Point is, even with a bad feedback or no feedback from you, I am just glad I could open up my
                own thoughts too :D. (I thank my papa Jacov for helping me muster enough balls to take initiative for once :D) He's the mastermind behind everything </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you hadn't get bored reading all the way to this part yet, wow...

        <div class="section-content">
            <h1>Events Told</h1>
            <p> Cheesy of you if you chose to skip the upper text and straight up explored the navigation bar ;-; . Allow me to speak of events that had happened after the reckoning. To
                begin with, I have achieved my ultimate goal of finally freeing myself of my ex-girlfriend's bullshit threats (sorry for my wording) however, it paid a hefty price when
                you cut off contact with me on March 18, 2024, exactly 7:07 pm. 346 days had passed. I respect your decision and I have deep regrets (I was not thinking, I went along with Dana's sabotaging plan) 
                for the selfishness my actions have caused. I explained everything to you on one last message on TikTok since my messager messages of me talking of the cult remained unseen,
                I had assumed you had me placed in your restricted group, if not, archive, I do not know what to assume. I had clung onto hope with nervousness I assumed as much you would 
                have already cut off my account in other platforms as well. I anticipated you'd be more active in TikTok so I sent the message there. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> I was not expecting any feedback from you considering the damage my immaturely selfish sabotaging my ex act had caused you, I do not want to leave the other side in the dark
                as well—so I still swallowed my chest and sent you a message on TikTok. I was relieved you had seen it (You gave it a 'heart' react). Then again, I assumed once again I was
                cut off completely and you had moved on with your life. That, I respect, so I had not sent any further message afterwards. I am not sure if you had seen my message on messenger
                or was it a misclick you had done on Friday but it sparked a little hope in me that I should take initiative (I thank that and Jacov for the inspiration), so now, here I am
                taking initiative. (Also cause I remember when you mentioned something in the past of studying in Baguio? Correct me if I am wrong.) But yes, I am turning third year this coming
                school year, I could not always keep hiding under my shell. Jacov slapped that truth at me. 
            </p>
            <p> I probably should not even be showing my face after I prioritized my agenda to get rid of my ex's threats. As I code this, I feel a slap on both my face and throat. I wanted to
                take initiative without expecting anything in return so I am doing this. I am not sure if you would even see this, or if you would bother reading through the entirety. That is fine,
                totally! Your emotions are fully valid and I respect that—I had shown respect by not intervening any further. Had I receive a feedback from you is purely scary on its own that I would
                slap myself numerous times before I open the feedback—if there is one, none? I can look up knowing I had tried :D
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> I am touched and scared if you had read through the entirety of this section. (Happy at the same time)

            <h1>Brief Recollection</h1>
            <p> I talked to my papa about it. My stepfather, was it a coincidence still at this point? I told him the full recount of events, the good and the bad. How I kept ending up with wrong
                women in the years—completely leaving you in the dark. He called me stupid, that's valid. I was also stupid. I recounted all events so far since the beginning of time on 2019 when you made
                that jump in front of my face till now. I visited our high school last Friday, bnchs. I stayed for a little bit with Jacov as we wandered around classrooms per floor. (Was hoping you'd be there
                or was I blind that day I  did not see you? I do not know really, but there were people doing drills I  think and some stem students watching below) Jacov saw through my agenda somehow, just a little
                disappointing it ended up just Jacov and I wandering around. Was hoping I'd get to have a proper conversation in person. (I sound confident yet in person my guts are all scared to the brim). On those 346 days,
                I had received a lot of both encouraging and scoldings from my friends (MAINLY WITH STEVEN AND DANA) and my papa. This is my karma for my acts of cowardice.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>  I am  not sure if you had read through everything, if you did till now, congrats :D
            </p>
            <p> By my own tongue, I grant you permission to slap my face as hard as you could (sabunot is optional but do as you please) if you come across me in person, wherever, whenever. Genuinely.

            <p> You all should remember that even in a good school, without the unwavering determination to learn, it is still the sole equivalent of just studying at a pay-to-win school. None learns.

            <p> Shifting courses is valid, yet it is for those with strong hearts.
