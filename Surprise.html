        <h2>Hey You!</h2>
        <h3><em>Had fun with the surprise boxes? If not, it's okay too!</em></h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            I have dedicated over two weeks to developing this website. While I'm proud of it, 
            I apologize if the quality fell short or if you find it lacking—I'm limited to what we've learned so far. 
            Everything here is based on what we've been taught during both our laboratory and lecture sessions with Ms. Queenee.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If you've read through everything and it led you here, I truly appreciate the time and effort you've invested in this project. 
            It means more than I can express hiding behind these huge chunks of code like an absolute coward..  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That said, after I send this to you, I'll evaporate for a while out of fear because this is my first time taking initiative and control
            over both my life and emotions, naturally, the fear of failure has crept in my system. Still, I await the outcome, whether good or bad.
            JUST KNOW THAT YOU AND YOURSELF IS VALID, always listen to what yourself truly wishes.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I found myself in a trance, lost in the story of my life alongside the great inevitable lessons it came with. I see both sorrow and beauty as beautiful, 
            each holding an undeniable allure. Six years of mistakes, selfishness, wrongdoings, and heartbreaks 
            have all led me to this single moment—the point where I finally listened to my own emotions and took initiative. 
            I was almost bewildered, and yet here I am, behind these chunks of code, it has become my greatest regret now that 
            I'm already on the crossroad where every choice I make from here on will shape my future. I would at least love to enter the journey my soul devoted itself to. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I fully understand that it may be far too late for anything, and that is valid—truly, your emotions are valid. 
            But even so, I can hold my head high, knowing that I have finally laid bare everything I once kept within, from that afternoon you jumped in front of me to now, 
            as I step into my junior year in college.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> I do not deserve to be talking like this, as cowardly as it is already hiding behind these codes, I could not face the fruit of my own
            negligence in your advances over these six years. 

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            No matter the result, just know that your thoughts and feelings are valid. Always choose what aligns with your heart and mind. 
            I created this as a way to put everything out from mine, and whatever you take from it—whether it aligns or not—is just as meaningful.  
            Do not restrict yourself with language you use, should you wish to not involve yourself in any involving my existence, do speak of it.
            I would not like to remain a nuisance if it is what it shows.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hence, I dedicate the very last I will ever allow myself to have, to indulge in something I know I will devote myself in fully. Let this serve
            all of its intended purposes. I expect none for only a narcissist will only expect an immediate fruit after the grueling six years of stupidity.
            Rather, should this bear good news, please, do speak. I do not and will not take it as fast, everything takes time,
            it does not have to be the immediate future. Should it bear the opposite, please, speak of it as well. Both are valid and will not be left
            ignored. If you have other interests or is actively engaged in a present relationship, please, do speak. I wish for none but to not plant
            misunderstandings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I hope this finds you well. I had more I wish to say, yet for the sake of not overloading this right away,
            I chose to speak of those with high importance to me. I long for none but for a response from you regarding this, be it good or not, 
            I await your news.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I apologize for any errors in my wordings, both my hand and my brain are shaking in agitation.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            At the very least, if you've read through it all, that alone is more than enough for me.  
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Have a good one, Dianne!
