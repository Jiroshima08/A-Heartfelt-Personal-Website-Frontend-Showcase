# I-might-die-for-this
A project by this aspiring software engineering student. (First time taking initiative)

This project was done while I was carrying my slacker of a group in our Systems Analysis and Design (Chapter 2).
This is a personal website containing everything important to me.

This person did not want to just do it the straightforward way with his fear of failure and rejectionâ€”so this fella did it in his way that 
he could hide his face right away after everything is complete. 

So without further ado~
