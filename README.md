# 💖 A Heartfelt Personal Website – Frontend Showcase

I built this as a frontend milestone contrary to my learnings with the fundamentals of our Web Development course. This project was my first independent initiative—taking the reins and carrying the team—using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to share what’s truly important to me.

## 🎯 Purpose

During our **Web Development** class, I chose to build something meaningful and a way to confess to someone: a deeply personal site that highlights my favorite pages, memories, and creative expression. I didn't want to do the standard group assignment—I needed something authentic that I could complete solo, at my own pace, and enjoyably.
